[EDV]:
	☐ Capture chunk metadata into Rocks/Level/etc (checksum, *DataNode.Id)
		- Database schema is agnostic to RDS, expectation is EDV is hostable without blockchain

		FileId_Metadata:
			```
			Key: fid

			Value:
			{
				status: "ASSIGNED" | "UPLOADED" | "DELETED",
				ca_timestamp: <ms>,
				lu_timestamp:	<ms>
			}
			```
			- Input: duration timestamp


		FileId_To_ChunkIds:
			```
			Key: fid

			Value:
			{
				checksum: <hex>,
				chunks: [ ...chunkId ],
				volume: <string>,
				ca_timestamp: <ms>,	(created)
				lu_timetsamp: <ms>,	(last updated)
				lt_timetsamp: <ms>	(last touched)
			}
			```

		ChunkId_Metadata:
			```
			Key: chunkId

			Value:
			{
				checksum: <hex>,
				volume: <string>,
				dataNodes: [
					{ }
				]
				ca_timestamp: <ms>,	(created)
				lu_timestamp: <ms>	(last updated)
				lt_timestamp: <ms>	(last touched)
			}
			```

	☐ API needs to be able to pull information from Chunk Datastore

[Private Networking]:
	☐ Configure Private VPC for Masters
		☐ Configure IG for Masters VPC
	☐ Configure Private VPC across Masters + Volumes
		- Host global distribution (different AZ)

[Security]:
	☐ Create special users for custom Gateway Docker image

	[DevOps]:
		☐	Define IAM / role-based policies for Docker (Linux) runtime

[Stress Test]:
	☐ Try to corrupt container data and check recovery
